On the other hand, the two heavier weighted A* runs both found slightly less optimal paths of length 19, but processed only 50 nodes in the 2x case and 29 in the 10x case. This shows A* drastically cuts down on processing time, but when the heuristic is not consistent there is no guarantee that the optimal state will be reached, while with Djikstra optimality is always guaranteed at the expense of processing power."
